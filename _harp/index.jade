				p.lead Embracing the unique benefits that being a multicultural technologist provides.
				p I have been a digital activist since 2009 when I was catalyzed into the undocumented youth movement because of my immigration status. Throughout my 6 years of digital organizing, I have learned digital skills that I noticed were usually missing in the immigrant community. 
				p Through PochoLabs, my goal is to make these skills available to the immigrant community by offering various solutions for social justice organizations and immigrant-owned businesses. 
				p This is a social enterprise, and as such, PochoLabs operates differently from other web development firms:
				ol
					li <strong>Creating more Latino Tech Entrepreneurs</strong>: For big projects, instead of hiring or subcontracting web developers, I instead create a partnership with other Latino-owned firms or freelancers for that specific project. Instead of offering a job, I like to offer business opportunities to fellow Latino web developers.
					li <strong>50% of the projects are pro-bono</strong>: This is a bit radical, but necessary for both the immigrant community and for me to grow as a developer.
